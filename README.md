# Get up!

A visual basic script which I made for ergonomic purposes. The script tells you in fixed intervals to get up from work and do some excercise! Very useful!

## Usage

The script is windows only.

Run the script, a popup window and sound will mark the end of your working session and tell you to take a 15 minute break.
